        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Ahmed Hussain, a student at Williams College, studying Mathematics, and Economics. I studied away at Harvard during my Junior year. I am interested in problems in ML and am particularly motivated by prediction models. Previously, I have worked with financial time series data, UFC fight data, and text data. I also try to read a book a week. You can check some of my book reviews in the Book Reviews tab. </p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>Outside of my professional work, I enjoy hiking the mountains around Williamstown, playing squash, and running.</p>
